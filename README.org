Validate is a set of simple validation functions for common lisp written to be used wherever user-provided data enters a program.  It's useful for APIs, text adventures, or whatever else takes in data that might not be in the form you're expecting.  It's a pretty simple library, but makes some effort to do The Right Thing with data, like converting a range of values to booleans (off, false, nil, &c.) and accepting strings that represent numbers as well as integer values (but they always come out integers!)

** Usage
The package has the nickname ~v~ so it's easier to work with.  You would probably find the [[https://github.com/nightfly19/cl-arrows][cl-arrows]] library useful, if you need to compose validators, especially the ~->~ macro (all the validation functions take the data to be validated as the first argument), which could be used like so.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (let ((favorite-potato (-> (parameter :potato)
                             (v:default "Yam")
                             v:str)))
    (save-favorite-potato favorite-potato))
#+END_SRC

Right now, validate has, effectively, two patterns for usage: the schema style and the ad-hoc validation style.

*** Validators
Validation functions all take a ~value~ as the first argument and zero or more configuration arguments that modify their behavior.  They may change the type of ~value~ (~v:int~ can decode strings, ~v:timestamp~ creates timestamps from strings) but they all generally expect their input will be a string.  If they can't validate the data they see, they throw a ~v:<validation-error>~.  That's about all there is to it.

- int

  ~radix~: What base is this number in?  Defaults to 10.  ~(v:int "F" :radix 16) == 15~

  ~min~, ~max~: What are the minimum and maximum values (inclusive) that are acceptable?  Doesn't check unless they're specified.

- bool

  Takes a variety of input strings and turns them into ~t~ or ~nil~.  Valid values include "y", "yes", "t", "true", "on", "enable" (and their false equivalents).

- str

  ~min-length~, ~max-length~: Minimum and maximum allowed length of the string.

- email

  Performs a basic check that the string resembles an email.  Checking exhaustively is hard and probably futile, so validate doesn't try.

- list

  ~length~: How long should the list be?  Does nothing unless specified.

  ~truncate~: If this is ~t~ and ~length~ is set, truncate the list at that length.

  ~element-type~: Accepts a validation function that is run on every member of a decoded JSON array.  For example, you might use ~(v:list data :element-type v:int)~ to validate a list of integers.

- timestamp

  Checks if the vale is a timestamp that [[https://github.com/dlowe-net/local-time][local-time]] can parse.

- default

  Use this to provide a default value if the data is empty (null or empty string, according to ~alexandria:emptyp~.  Useful for, well, default values.


*** How to use the library

I wrote the schema style to mirror [[https://github.com/alecthomas/voluptuous][Voluptuous]] for Python, but then I ended up not using it much in practicality.

To use the schema-style, despite my boredom with it, you can do this:

(From the test suite)
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (let ((schema '(:name          ((v:str :min-length 1))
                  :age           ((v:int))
                  :has-dog       ((v:bool))
                  :email         ((v:email))
                  :favorite-food ((v:default "pizza") (v:str :min-length 3))))

          (data   '(:name    "matt"
                    :age     "27"
                    :has-dog "no"
                    :email   "something@example.com")))

      (v:with-validated-values (name
                                age
                                (dog has-dog) ;; Value bound to a different name
                                email
                                favorite-food)
          (schema data)

        (is name          "matt")
        (is age           27)
        (is dog           nil)
        (is email         "something@example.com")
        (is favorite-food "pizza")))
#+END_SRC

To use the ad-hoc style, write your own condition handler something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (handler-case
      (let ((name (v:str (get-parameter :name))))
        (render-a-template :name name))

    (v:<validation-error> (e)
       (respond-with-a-400)))
#+END_SRC
